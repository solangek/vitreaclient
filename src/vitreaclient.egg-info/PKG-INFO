# Vitrea

Python package encapsulating the simple Vitrea box communication protocol.
You need to identify the VBox fixed IP address and port to use this package.
The VBox usually listens to 3 ports, one of them is used by the Vitrea application,
another is used for admin purposes, and the third one is used for communication 
with external systems such as this package.

## Installation

```bash
pip install vitreaclient
```

## Usage

```python
from vitreaclient.client import VitreaClient, VitreaResponse, DeviceStatus
import asyncio


async def vitrea_test():
    client = VitreaClient(host='192.168.1.100', port=11111)

    status_events = []
    def on_status(event):
        print(f"Event type: {event.type}, Node: {event.node}, Key: {event.key}, Status: {event.status}, data: {event.data}")
        status_events.append(event)

    client.on(VitreaResponse.STATUS, on_status)

    def on_ok(event):
        print(f"Event type {event.type}")

    client.on(VitreaResponse.OK, on_ok)

    # connect and start the read task to listen for incoming messages
    await client.connect()

    await client.key_off("018", "2")  # Example command to turn on a key
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    await client.key_on("018", "2")  # Example command to turn off a key

    # get the status of all nodes
    await client.status_request()

    await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Give time for response
    print(f"Status events received: {len(status_events)}")
    # unsubscribe from events
    client.off(VitreaResponse.STATUS, on_status)
    client.off(VitreaResponse.OK, on_ok)
    
    client.disconnect()



```
